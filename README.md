# TheSecret-Software
This repository is focused on software that can decrypt any hidden meaning in the verses, images or the story itself. Image manipulation and image overlaying is a fundamental aspect of the initial software release. Language AI and image recognition will be developed, by implementing OpenCV. VB.NET and C# are the preferred languages of choice.
The GDPCipher.zip is a rough example of a Giambattista della Porta's cipher disc, for English using 28 symbols including a space and a period.
